# Some quick reminders

## Creating a new book

1. Clone this template book repository to a new repository owned by Warhorn Media on GitHub
  - Please use the format "authorlastname-short-title" to name the new repo
2. Clone the new repo to your computer and navigate into its folder in a command prompt
3. Run the following commands locally
  travis encrypt GITHUB_PAT=yourTokenGoesHere --add
	git checkout --orphan gh-pages
	git rm -rf .
	touch .nojekyll
	git add .nojekyll
	git commit -m"Initial commit"
	git push origin gh-pages
4. Add the project on travis-ci.com (You may have to log out and back in for the project to show up.)

*Congrats!* You now have a new book that will rebuild automatically any time you push changes to github.
